  "text": "This hotel is just a stone’s throw away from times square and is in a great location to get about easily. The room itself was not the biggest but you don’t expect a large room in New York, it was clean and nicely presented, enough wardrobe space for two people. Bathroom was very modern with a large shower but no bath but that did not bother us. Bed was extremely comfortable. They have the pool in the hotel which was a bonus, only wish we could have used it more, after a day of walking about we had a few hour relax in the pool and the bar served us drinks via a little window. All the hotel staff where welcoming and helpful with any of our needs. We found next door there was two deli’s that severed breakfast so we did not have breakfast in the hotel at all. Over all would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to New York and would defiantly stay there again.",

  "title": "Great find ! ",
  "text": "What a lucky find this hotel was ! I picked it primarily for location- which was perfect but it excelled in every area. We were upgraded to a queen sized room for the bargain price of ten dollars a night, the room was gorgeous - just quirky enough to make it different - not huge but enough space for what we needed- superbly comfy bed and quality bedding, the shower was fantastic - really spacious and very powerful. Staff were without exception friendly,welcoming and helpful- lovely guy who sits at the desk downstairs using his own phone to ring my limo when I couldn’t work out how to get through. We asked for a late check out - not a problem , another thing I must mention is the cleanliness - every single time we stepped out of the lift - we were in 1005- there was a guy cleaning the carpets, consequently there was none of that stale smell you can get in hotel corridors- it always smelt clean and fresh. I love New York and will return - I will never stay anywhere else - well done guys - huge pat on the back to you all!!",

  "text": "Great stay in NYC!! Hotel is so cute! We got to the hotel before check in time. We were unable to check in early but they had a luggage holding area that was very safe and secure. We stayed for 6 night in early May. The price was amazing for being right in the heart of Times Square. Great location if you are seeking something in the middle of all the action. Subway station is also very close. Breakfast is offered although we didn't eat it. Free wifi is offered! Rooms are small but that is to be expected in the city. Even though the rooms are small the space is utilized great. We had a standard queen room and our luggage and everything fit great. The bathroom is pretty spacious. Walk in shower was huge for the room size. Room has a safe for valuables. Housekeeping staff was great and kept room stocked with clean linens everyday and tidy. We were never bothered by the noise of the city when sleeping. Would recommend this hotel to everyone interested in staying in the center of the city on a budget.",
