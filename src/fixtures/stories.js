      Online ratings and reviews are absolutely critical to commercial success in today's economy. As early as 2012 a <a href="https://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/chrpubs/5">study from Cornell University</a> showed that if a hotel on Tripadvisor could increase their average customer reviews by just one star, they could increase their prices by up to 11.2% without affecting their occupancy rate.
