I created a fixed-price project based on this and on a low-hourly rate - as this is a private project with limited budget. Amongst all the offers from low hourly rates, he had the highest hourly rate - however at the time of awarding the project I did not notice that. To my surprise, the project was finished within hours of awarding although the due date was 1 week later. If you are in a time hurry, this freelancer is a good choice - the high hourly rate will compensate in terms of time. I can recommend this freelancer for iOS related work.",
