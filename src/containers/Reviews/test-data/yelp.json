  "description": "This place is delightful! Located downtown, I can see why it wouldn't get the usual midtown/Chelsea crowd, but it definitely deserves it. The aesthetic of the place is beautiful, perfect for those must-have IG shots. The servers are polite and helpful, and the food is delicious. I will also say it never gets too loud, so conversations are easy to have here.\n\nI went a few weeks back, so I apologize for the lack of details, but we ordered a few dishes: spinach artichoke dip, fried chicken, mushroom, and a few other items. Everything was absolutely delicious and plated nicely. This is a great place for a date, and it's on my list to come back for brunch!",

It was a very cute place, it was a party of 10 so we got seated upstairs felt like we had our own private place. The food was amazing, we ordered a variety of appetizers which included grilled oysters, fried chicken, soup, mushrooms and French fries. And everything was great \nWe ordered many things for dinner as it was 10 people and everyone ordered different things so basically we tried almost everything, the service was amazing too. \nAll in all super happy with the place and the service \nA must try for sure",

  "description": "Wanted to go out and relax during Memorial weekend, so I got a $39 PulsD which included 2 entrees & bottomless mimosas, bellinis, and bloody mary's. I set reservations at 2:30 on Saturday and for a Saturday it wasn't packed-pretty quiet. We had two hosts. 1 was awesome, the other was awkward and a little weird. So service was 4. \nFood was 4 too. I got the Norwegian eggs and my boyfriend got waffles and chicken. The Norwegian eggs were yummy and filling. The waffles and chicken were good but not great. We both liked it but was not in love with it. We also had a side order of bacon from the neighboring customers. They couldn't finish it. When it came out we all looked and laughed because they were thick slices that looked like steaks lol. Looked fatty but actually wasn't. It was pretty decent. It should be ordered for more than 1 person though. \nDrinks were flowing and were normal. Nothing extraordinary. \n& there is a fee $3.47 of having a pre-ordered order I guess. I've never experienced that with a PulsD order before and have been using for about 3 years. Maybe it's new, maybe it's the restaurant. All in all, I'll be back to try other options.",

  "description": "Pretty restaurant on the corner of Church Street. High Ceilings, lots of windows/natural light. Great place for a group of friends getting together for brunch/dinner or a date. \n\nWe started with the crawfish and rice croquettes. Crunchy on the outside. Pronounced flavor from the crawfish. Plenty to share between two/three people. They provide their own salsas, a green one and a spicy one. Good to try with the croquettes. \n\nEntrees - Green curry boneless fried chicken. Really good! It comes with mac and cheese as an automatic side which was delicious. The macaroni was al dente and had an exterior crunch. Super cheesy. The fried chicken was very well seasoned with a nice flavoring from the green curry. Chicken was moist on the inside. Well executed.\n\nMaple-bourbon glazed duck breast - very filling. The sweet potato mash was delicious, super soft and mashed to a creamy consistency. The duck breast was cooked well and was moist as well. \n\nOverall, a wonderful dinner in a good atmosphere.",

Down to earth and a wonderful addition to the nabe.\n\n+++++ \nI have been here three times now -- with a large group on a weekend, weekend brunch and weekday lunch. The food is actually superb. If you are the type that likes a bit of spice without blow your hat off hot, this place is pretty amazing. It's not the same spicy flavor either. Good mix. The ceviche is \"pause the conversation\" good. Same with Jambalaya. Lentils have deep flavor. The cavernous space also feels great and really fits the Tribeca feel. Food also comes quick. Wine selections are really solid. Can't really think of anything negative. A very welcome entrant to the community.",

  "description": "Came in Saturday with four others for dinner.  The decor was really fun, with brightly patterned tropical wallpaper and a second floor that looked out over the main floor.  We were seated in a cozy booth towards the back, so noise wasn't an issue.\n\nWe started with crawfish croquettes, which were very tasty but nothing too unique.  For the mains, we got (in order of awesomeness):\n- Green curry fried chicken with mac and cheese - It looked like the chicken was coated in curry paste and then breaded.  Really unique and really delicious.  The mac and cheese was very creamy.  Portion was huge.\n- Coffee marinated filet - Also super tasty.  The coffee flavor really came through, and there was also a little sweetness.\n- Vegan jambalaya - We loved that this place offered an interesting vegan option.  Everything was well-seasoned, and the tofu was cooked well.\n- Pan seared bass - The fish was cooked really well, but was a little plain on its own.  The crushed spring peas were great.\nWe ended with the bread pudding, coconut lime pie, and beignets, all of which were good (though the chocolate sauce for the beignets was a little more bitter than I would have liked).  Value for the amount of food was quite good.  Overall, would definitely recommend checking this place out.",

Two tiered with plants hanging, and a good view of the bar overhead. Service was quick and the waitresses were very nice. They refilled drinks when the glasses looked near empty, and were overall very attentive.\n\nThe food had large portions too! I ordered the Norwegian eggs, which were eggs benedict over smoked salmon over a biscuit. This came with hash browns (the shredded kind, actually somewhat burnt) and salad (barely any dressing). However, the eggs and biscuit were delicious.\n\nAlso tried some of the bacon as part of the eggs and bacon meal. Thick cut bacon, though quite salty so better eaten with eggs and not by themselves.\n\nOverall a great deal on a great place.",

We came in around 1pm and found it pleasantly empty. We were seated and handed menus almost instantly. Lunch specials were pretty good- all meals came with a free beer or soup. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with a glass a beer. I didn't have high expectations but yo, my grilled chicken sandwich was on da money. SO GOOD and if you don't know anything about me, all you need to know is that I love karaoke and crispy chicken. Dassit. The chicken was seasoned, grilled and charred  perfectly- almost to the point of no return. It was served with bacon, avocado, tomato and pickled jalapeno. I washed it down with a beer and called it a day. I was so happy with my meal I didn't eat for the rest of the day.",

  "description": "TLDR: nice ambience; friendly staff; mediocre food\n\nWanted to check out this place after walking by a few times and thinking it looked cute. Decided to stop by on a Monday around 8pm with a friend. It was pretty empty and we had no trouble getting a booth in the back. 1803 describes itself as an \"upscale take on Cajun-Creole food & drink, with a look inspired by New Orleans's French Quarter.\" The decor was reminiscent of NOLA, with a white marble bar, white brick walls, pink and green floral wallpaper, dim lighting, and an ornate white metal gate on the second floor balcony. \n\nTo start, we got the spinach-artichoke heart dip, which came with two large baskets of standard restaurant-style tortilla chips. The dip was served hot and was cheesy and delicious. For my entree, I ordered the fried chicken drumsticks, which came with coleslaw and mac & cheese. Although it came with two drumsticks that were cooked well, the skin and chicken itself had very little flavor, which was disappointing. Similarly, the coleslaw wasn't memorable and the mac & cheese was good but very heavy.\n\nIf I'm craving Cajun-Creole food in the city, would likely opt for something with less frills and more flavor, but a nice spot in Tribeca for ambiance.",

I guess it's for smaller parties and there was 6 or 7 of us. We sat off to the side in one of the booths. Our waiter for very nice! The drinks were very very nicely made. I totally recommend \"Oh the places you'll go.\" On one minor annoying note. There was a slight mishap with our apps... and we had to flag two servers about the 45 minute wait for tator tots and fried green tomatoes. We ended up getting one free app and one app completely taken off it the bill which we felt was more than enough. (You had my forgiveness at FREE) lol Now let's get to the food... very good. (Felt like the portions could be bigger) but overall very good meal. I had the green curry fried chicken with MAC and cheese. Now I'm a mac and cheese snob. This... was everything I needed mac and cheese to be. Very cheesy, bread crumbs on top. I think I found my new after work chill spot!",

This deal included an entree and unlimited drinks for two people. Sucha steal. \n\nLike many, I never come down past Canal Street for brunch. This place is a real hidden gem, with crazy cute decor and a mouthwatering menu. I jumped on ordering the eggs Benedict with lox. Not sure if it was the mimosas or my empty stomach, but the food was delicious.\n\nSo to sum it up, I cannot wait till the next time I can have bottomless brunch here. Cheers!",

  "description": "So my sister recommended this restaurant as a great place to go on a date. The ambience is bright, romantic and New Orleans feel. It's so beautiful inside it automatically puts you in a great mood. I ordered the secret garden cocktail, it had cucumbers coming out of it so the fresh vegetables taste was very present and they put a good amount of alcohol in itThe food was ok. I ordered the cornmeal fried oysters which wasn't what I wanted (my fault) but next time I want to get the oysters in garlic or marinara sauce, I'm sure that would've been much better. Then I looked through the entree options which was rather small and decided to order from the appetizer menu with a side dish. I got the crab cakes and Mac and cheese. Crab cakes could've been crispy and they would've been way better. The Mac and cheese was amazing! I could've had a huge plate of the Mac and cheese and would've been happy. On that note I want to go to their brunch which yelpers have been raving about and I'm sure my experience will be much much better. The staff was extremely nice, friendly, and attentive. I would go back and choose different options.",

  "description": "The ambience in this place is amazing, especially if you go during a sunny day. The high windows, pink flower wallpaper, and open second level really make for a nice place. Came here for bottomless brunch with a $39 brunch for 2 puls'd special and we weren't disappointed. I would definitely say the brunch food is better most other brunch spots I've been to. They don't really skim out on the food. I got the Norwegian eggs which basically was eggs Benedict with some lox. It was tasty. Hashbrowns were on the crunchy side which I didn't really like but everyone has their own preference. The staff was super nice and accommodating, always made sure the bottomless brunch glasses, stayed bottomless. They have a bar in the middle too if you would just like to drink. The liquor is of good quality. Lot of dark liquor. I'd definitely come back for brunch. The deal was definitely worth it.",

  "description": "I came here for a late lunch one day.  To be honest, I first thought I was going to the restaurant that used to be in this location, but I realized that things had changed pretty quickly.\n\nLet me start off with the service.  I was alone, so I ate at the bar.  There were two bartenders.  They were positively delightful.  They were friendly and attentive.\n\nThe place has a nice beer selection, which was my beverage for lunch.  I noticed they had a nice choice of bourbons as well.\n\nThe menu is a bit limited; they don't have a ton choices.  I went with the burger.  It was terrific.  I must admit that cajun food is usually too spicy for me, so I shied away from most of the menu -- but that is my hangup.\n\nIf you find yourself in TriBeCa, this is a good place to go for a drink and/or a bite.",

  "description": "So this was a super pleasant surprise\n\nIt's not that my expectations for this brunch were super low, but when you get a buy one get one you don't really set the bar that high. I mean sure, we have found some real gems over the years through deals (RIP Chelsea drag brunch, you are missed) but for the most part bogo brunches are meh' at best. Not so with 1803. Not sure if they are just trying to get the word out or what, but they do a KILLER brunch. \n\nFirst thing of note is the NOLA feel to this place, which absolutely works for this place as their staff def has that southern charm nailed down (seriously, everyone who works here is super nice, they even gave us a few \"come back and have brunch at a discount\" cards). You can feel it in the food too - looking for a po'boy? You've got it. There is also a sense of NYC to the joint, in that the 2hr bottomless mimosas both started on time, ended on time, and were strong as hell. The food was (in my humble opinion), outstanding; I had the sausage breakfast skillet that came with a (presumably) house made biscuit. The potatoes hidden under the sausage, egg and copious amounts of cheese was a perfect touch. The true magic here, as with all great brunch places, was the refill game - the second I made eye contact with our server, the pitcher came flying out from behind the (cool looking) bar. Seriously, spot on here. \n\nCheck this place out if you're looking for a southern style brunch spot..or even if you're not (the Nicoise tuna salad was calling my name hard..but you know, sausage...).",

  "description": "Took a friend there for lunch to celebrate her birthday.  I was excited for the menu and had high hopes in light of the reviews and pictures. So we ordered the friend green tomatoes, oyster po' boy sandwich and gumbo. The fried green tomatoes were a bit greasy and one of the tomato pieces we received had part of the stem in it. When you cut into it, the whole thing falls apart and you can't cut through the tomato. Plus, $10 was a bit steep for 3 pieces of fried green tomatoes. The flavor of the oyster po' boy was delicious but the oysters were over fried. Highlight was the gumbo...  There were plenty of seafood in it and the flavor was enough spicy with cajun flavor. Wished it came with rice instead of toast but I would order it again. Overall nice ambiance with hits and misses with the food.",

  "description": "Man, I can't praise this restaurant enough. Only after one visit it is easily one of my favorite places in New York to eat. Best brunch options than most places and the portions are generous but not in the 'I'm an American that overeats' kind of way. I still haven't figured out what they put in their mimosas but they are heavenly. Not the typical mimosa. Seriously. It's a secret formula. Decided to check them out because of a deal on puls'd. 2 entrees and 2 hours of bottomless drinks for $39 but I look forward to returning. I wish I remembered our server's name because I would love to give her a shoutout. She was amazing, waiting on 6 people, during a boozy brunch, in NYC, and doing it with grace and finesse is no small feat. Thanks to you nameless waitress. lol",

Everything was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious! The bottomless brunch deal includes 3 different drinks - mimosas, Bellinis and bloody Mary's. We drank delicious bellinis all morning. The entire restaurant is so beautiful and pleasing to the eye. The only downside was that there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant, including the birthday party upstairs. It was hard to get her attention and took a while to refill our drinks. They need to have more staff on hand as it's too much work for one person to do!",

  "description": "Another first. I thought I was looking at the current menu via online. I was disappointed that catfish was no longer on the menu. What saved my dining experience is The Winter Salad with arugala, farro, beets, avocado, pumpkin seeds, and goat cheese. I opted to add Cajun Tuna, cooked thru. From my lips to probably the waiter's notes, my tuna was seared only. I placed the tuna onto the appetizer dish and flagged the nearest waiter to send it back to the kitchen to have the tuna cooked-thru. 5 long mins later, I was a happy customer again. There's a Santa amount of beets, avocado, goat cheese. I suppose the meat of this salad is supposed to be the tuna and arugula. And the basil-tarragon dressing is unique, light in flavor and paired nicely with the entire salad bowl.\n\nIn retrospect, there was no farro in the salad. I love farro. \n\nWe did come during happy hour. I ordered the Secret Garden and Le Paradisio. Both seem to lack alcohol. Oh well.\n\nThe best path to the bathrooms located in the left corner, ground level is to walk thru the right aisle and then left.\n\nResto was buzzing early Friday evening, the bar area was packed, everyone standing. Bar seats were all occupied.",

The waitress was so kind and helpful- I told her I didn't like one of the ingredients in the drink and she offered to change it up for me. She came by often to refill our water and didn't keep bothering us with the 'how's everything?' small talk. She came when we needed her and was so sweet. \n\nNow the food! \n\nThe pulled pork sandwich is one of the best ones I've ever had in the city. It's so moist and there's a slight crunch in the sandwich, which I couldn't figure out what it was, but it gave the sandwich that extra umpfhhhh. \n\nSpinach-Artichoke dip was SO GOOD. There's a Cajun kick to the chips so extra tasty points there. \n\nAlso got the soft polenta (wild mushroom and truffles) and grilled chili-garlic oysters. Those were good too but the pulled pork sandwich and spinach artichoke dip outshined them. \n\nThe ambience was good, small and cute place but it's strategically designed to fit as many people as possible without being squished. There's an adorable second level, some booths in the back, and space for parties of 8 in the front.",

Tried the Oysters with the vinaigrette and was to die for too. But the killer was the Pulled pork sandwich! OMG it was too darn good. I hate them! Now I'm going to dream about that sandwich damn it! I regret not coming here before. Highly Recommended! Id give them more stars if I could. Had to edit the post after trying the bread pudding, now I hate them even more! It's so delicious is wrong!",

  "description": "1803 is a fun and lively bar and restaurant.  We enjoyed a pre-comedy club drink and light meal there.  It turned out to be happy hour so the prices were reasonable.\n\nThe decor is fun and we sat up on the balcony overlooking the bar.\n\nWe enjoyed the time there and it fit what we needed, however, the food was really just OK and it's pretty loud so be prepared for that.",

  "description": "I came here for the first time last weekend for my friend's birthday brunch with a group of about 15 people. He had found 1803 on puls'd with a bottomless brunch deal and it was probably the best brunch I've experienced in a long time. The waitstaff was incredibly tentative and made sure we had enough drinks the entire time. Usually when I go to a bottomless brunch I assume the food won't be that great, but this was an exception. All of us loved our brunch entrees - I split the andouille sausage casserole and the pulled pork Benedict with my friend. It was all amazing. I'm still thinking about their incredibly crunchy hash browns.",

Bought a $39 deal for bottomless brunch for 2 on Pulsd and this is one of the best places I've tried using the platform. \n\nDelicious selection of Cajun dishes take a spin on traditional brunches. I had the Oyster Po Boy which was delicious! My brother had 3 eggs scrambled with slab bacon and cheese grits.\n\nFriendly and courteous service and yes the mimosas and bellinis were free flowing.\n\nExtra points for the beautiful vibe and decor.",

  "description": "I live in the area and it appears that this restaurant was recently renovated and converted into a New Orleans/Cajun type of restaurant. I had never been to the previous restaurant, but it appears that the renovation has gone well.\n\nI went with 3 other friends for dinner at around 6pm on a Thursday night. We had made a reservation and were promptly seated, although our seats were on high tops on the first floor rather than the dining area on the second floor. In any case, we were right in the middle of happy hour which runs from 5-7pm and the drink and food specials were very good. $3 off beers, wines, and cocktails and discounted food menu that was very filling. All in all, a solid spot for a drink after work or for a tasty meal with a Southern flavor.",

  "description": "What a perfect Valentine's Day we had thanks to this place!  Making a reservation on Yelp was easy. We arrived a few minutes early and were seated promptly. The hostess handed over a beautiful rose to me once I was comfortably seated. \n\nI was in awe of the interiors the whole time. What a gorgeously done intimate space. Loved the lighting too. We came in at 6 and made a wise use of the happy hour (4-7pm) prices which are applicable to both drinks and appetizers. Cocktails are $11 each (vs $14 without HH). I wish they had a better discount on that.\n\nHH appetizers are in the range of $6-7 each and delectable! Highly recommend the \"Polenta\" with truffle and mushrooms. Next fave was the barbecue shrimp that was grilled to perfection. Pulled pork mini sandwich was good too. Avoid the fried oyster sandwich. The other dish which pleasantly surprised me was the fried bacon with beets. I am not a fan of beets, but loved this combo!\n\nAs we step out we see pretty pink rose petals scattered on the pavement right outside the restaurant. What a romantic end to a lovely night!",

  "description": "1803 - cute restaurant on the corner of a quiet street off City Hall area.  If my friend didnt decide to have her birthday dinner here - I probably would've never known it existed.\n\nDecor, is cute here.  However the food was a little on the dissapointing side.  They were out of Gumbo (which was what the birthday girl was craving).  As a party of about 10 girls, we tried the spinach artichoke dip, crab cakes, chicken wings, croquettes, grilled oysters, grilled romaine salad, jambalaya, and the salmon, and some sides.  The standout of the meal was probably and honestly the grilled romaine salad.  The grilled oysters were good - but they were literally the size of maybe a quarter, and it was quite pricey.  Drinks here were good - they have a HH special, and the cocktails are nicely crafted. - but if you dont make it in time for that, the regular drink menu adds up pretty quick.\n\nOverall, the restaurant has potential, the decor is super cute - so date night would probably be recommended.",

  "description": "1803, which I'm told is named after the year of the Louisiana Purchase, has darn good New Orleans-inspired food. For my main course, I had the Louisiana style pulled pork sandwich, and it was top notch. Tender meat, flavorful rub and sauce that gave it a nice tang without getting too heavy.  The handcut fries were perfect, and the small side salad was fresh.\n\nThe service was awesome. Friendly, fast, helpful, and informed.  And 1803 has a nice vibe inside. There's enough seating and you have enough space.  The decor plays with some homey southern kitchen themes, but polishes it that up, making it comfortable and casual but also nice enough for a professional lunch or an evening out with friends.\n\nThere's a full bar with a respectable drink menu, though the beer options are a little limited.\n\nAll in all, I had a great experience at 1803. Great food, great service, cool atmosphere, and it seemed like a pretty good value for their prices to me.",

  "description": "Came her for a holiday lunch with some coworkers. We went around lunch and they had a lunch special of clauiflower soup and beer. Half of our party was seated prior to our arrival. Once we were seated, I checked the bathroom out. It was very clean and it was very retro/antique style. Pretty kool actually!! \n\nI love that they have an upstairs for dinning as well and its a very cozy and friendly atmosphere. For appetizers we ordered the \"fried green tomatoes\", \"Louisiana crab cake\" and the \"orange-chipotle spice chicken wing\". I have never tried fried tomatoes but it was my first time and it was good. Crunchy and not sweet nor sour. The crab cakes were soft and moisted. My favorite of them all was the wings because the sauce it was covered in it was very savoury and there was a light kick of spice on the tongue. \n\nBecause our party was large, our entres took a while but the pulled pork sandwich was ordered a few times and my coworkers highly recommend it. I ordered the mac and cheese with the drumsticks and a side of garlic mash. I loved the serving size and how it was decorated. The mac and cheese with mash was delicious. Definitely southern comfort food. The chicken was good especially with the hot sauce but I would prefer a little more salt on my chicken.",

  "description": "Sat at the bar with a friend for food and drinks.  I had a glass of red wine and he had a few mixed drinks, and we ordered the fried green tomatoes and butternut squash.  Both were great but the butternut squash was a standout for me as it was very cheesy (brie cheese) with some raisins, so the flavors worked really well together.  The only element of the experience I'd say was \"off\" was the music.  If the theme of 1803 is New Orleans/southern, it would have been nice if they played music which likened to that theme.",

  "description": "I had lunch here, and would again. I have lived here in the neighborhood for 10 years and seen countless restaurants in this space - I hope this one survives. The ambience is casual and the food is spot-on. I think this is a jamming after work drinks place, and I could see it being that part of the attraction for the Civic Center crowd. The wine and mixed drinks menu looked good as did other kinds of food from the table next to me.\n\nI had the Jambalaya and a Cajun Tuna Salad and both were fresh and yum - a bit pricey ($37 for the two selections).",

  "description": "Discovered 1803 by accident while being on jury duty, roaming around for a lunch place.\n\nThis first thing that strikes you is the friendliness of the staff.  Then, the airiness of the space.  But the definite wow factor is the food.  So far, jambalaya, fried green tomatoes, muffaletta, gumbo and more specifically the rice and crawfish croquettes.  All home runs.  Served with their home made hot sauces.  When I mentioned being addicted to the croquettes the owner, Raphael, asked if I wanted the recipe.  Did I ever!  Looking forward to trying my hand at those soon.\n\nWe are going to find ourselves some excuses to come from the uws to 1803 for the wonderful experience they provide!",

It's Friday, we had a long week and we needed some libations to go along with girl talk. The restaurant is newly renovated and it has a NOLA french quarter feel which i love because my family originates from there. The menu was creole cajun infused and I've been craving gumbo. To my surprise that is the first thing mentioned on the menu. I ordered gumbo with a side of mac n cheese and my friend ordered crab cakes with a side of mac. IT WAS AMAZING. The gumbo is by far one of the best gumbo's ive ever had. Even though we sat at the bar, the waitress was very attentive and the drinks were perfect. We will for sure be going back.",

Their fried oysters, rice croquettes and jamabalya are sososo good. Also we tried their bread pudding louisiana style (a drizzle of whisky on top) and it was seriously out of this world. We need more restaurant like this in NY, if not the world lol. Im not being dramatic. This place is just rlly rlly rlly rlly good.",

  "description": "Agree with everyone, good for groups (it appeared more intimate seating was available also).  The menus were small - food and drinks both - but every single item we ordered was delicious. I am very happy to have eight entree options guaranteed to be amazing rather than a wide variety of hit or misses. The food was fantastic, and our drinks were strong and tasty.  We appreciated how much spinach (lots) was in the spinach artichoke dip, and they happily brought us more chips for it.  The duck was AMAZING.  The mashed potatoes were a cloud.  The pulled pork so moist (yes, moist) and tender....My ONLY complaint - reason for the four stars rather than five, and plenty of people wouldn't care about this issue - was that the menu was not descriptive enough.  For example, it didn't say that the sandwich had pickles on it (my friend hates pickles and would have asked for without), and it didn't say what the smothered pork chops were smothered ~with~ or that the BBQ shrimp are a dry BBQ.  Might have been an intentional choice by the chef, but when you don't have many items to choose from it's nice to have a well rounded idea of what they are and what they come with.  Lastly, our waitress was really wonderful.",

  "description": "We tried 1803 with a group of 8. They seated us on balcony. Superior service from Karen. Shared many apps, especially enjoyed grilled oysters, ceviche, fried green tomatoes, spinach dip, chicken wings. Jambalaya (some got veggie version) very good. Catfish very good. Arugula salad tasty. Big burger. Most had wine and beer but one tried Hurricane for that New Orleans experience. \n\nFor us, a festive, yet comfortable spot with nice food tastes, pretty environment, and a very reasonable price point.\n\nWe thought green sauce hotter than red!",

  "description": "Boy do I miss Church Publik. \n\nFood is completely flavorless, almost to the point that I wonder if they intentionally aimed to make their food as bland as possible. \n\nThe decor is white with big pink flowers and comes painted on... Enough said. \n\nThe service was also pretty terrible. Our water flavored meals took a very long time and when I did get it, it was wrong. \n\nThe waitress and overall staff seemed to have a subtle but obvious shit attitude to the point that everytime we interacted with staff, everyone at our table would look at each other to confirm what was painfully obvious. \n\nAnd to top it off it was overpriced. \n\nJust don't do it, there are so many better places literally a stones throw away. \n\nAvoid this no good, very bad",

  "description": "I REALLY wanted to like 1803, we need more casual mid-level restaurants in the neighborhood, but the food and service just weren't great. The food was mediocre at best - had the fried chicken with mac n' cheese and the burger. The fried chicken was WAY too salty, the mac n' cheese was tasty, but super runny; and the burger was just OK. My favorite part of the meal were the fries, I give those a thumbs up.\n\nThe decor is cute and the drinks are good. Would probably only go back for cocktails and maybe appetizers.",

  "description": "Great space!  The portions are generous and encourage sharing. During happy hour the place is alive and bustling with an after work crowd. In no way does this bog down the food service or libations. The staff are welcoming and well equipped. \n\nI recommend the duck breast. It came with a fluffy mashed potato. The glaze has an undertone of smoky flavor and the bourbon adds depth.\n\nMy wine choice was the Cabernet.",

  "description": "When I used to work in TriBeCa it was quite difficult to find a bar with the perfect mixture of a personal space and a cool vibe , so when I came across 1803 I had wished I found the place sooner ! The food was great, the drinks were smooth and the staff was as sweet as only the south can offer . Definitely one of the best gems this city has to offer, and they're open till late which is untypical of businesses in that area , so it's perfect both for drinks after work and a late night date  highly recommended.",

And most importantly, the food is exceptional - notably the ceviche, which was perfectly done. \n\nI also had some cocktail with passion fruit juice that was too good. The kind of drink that goes too fast and you can drink too many of.\n\nNext time, I'll bring my partner, seems like a perfect date spot.",

Both the grilled and fried oysters are so good. The shrimp & andouille jambalaya is amazing. Fried green tomatoes, grits, all on point. They have a great bar scene and the drinks are also really special. Best Sazeracs in the city!",
